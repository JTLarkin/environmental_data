2. I would describe the histogram as realitivly bell shaped. The peak of the histogram is around 380 meters. which falls more on the left-hand side of the plot. This means that there are more lower elevation sites sampled than higher elevation sites. 

3. Percent. The values range from 0-110%. 

4. I would describe the shape of the slope histogram as being relatively bell shaped. However, there are more sites that fall in the lower percent slope than higher, with the most sites falling in the 40%-70% slope range.

5. Aspect is the degree in which a slope is faced. It can take on any value between 0 degrees and 360 degrees. 0/360 degrees are north, 90 degrees east, 180 degrees south, 270 degrees west.

6. The aspect histogram is evenly distributed. This means that all aspects have roughly the same number of sites, making the histogram almost look like a plateau. The histogram as a steep drop at the end as final bar (360-400 degrees) has significantly less sites. This is because the sites that fall in this range were errors as aspect is only measured between 0 and 360 degrees.

7. The lines I plotted look better when they are not squished together. I have figured out how to space out the plots yet.

8. 
  * Elevation: I think that there is a clear negative linear association between total basal area and elevation. I think that my model is an okay fit for the data, but it could be better.
  * Aspect: I do not think that there is really any association between aspect and basal area. I think that my model is a good fit for the data as it has no slope (slope= 0) and there is no association.
  * Slope: I think there is a slight negative association between slope and basal area. I think that my model is an okay fit, but could be improved.
