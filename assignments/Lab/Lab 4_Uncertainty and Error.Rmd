4. As we increased the number randomly generated data points the histograms became more normally distributed.Histograms with a lower number of randomly generated data points appeared to be more uniformly distributed.Additionally, some of the histograms had a different number of columns. Finally, as one could expect, the scale of the y-axis changed as the number of random data points increased.   

5. The shapes of the histograms are different because they have differing amounts of data points.
